You can currently create up to 10 orgs to manage different kinds of
activities. To create an org, you can either select =/neworg= from the
Telegram menu or type =/neworg= when talking to =@OrgEventBot= as
shown in the video below. You will need to click on the ="org"= button
to choose the name of your organization.

After you create a new organization, you will probably want to tell
your friends or colleagues the name of the new org, suggest they
[[#create-a-telegram-account-if-necessary][Create a telegram account if necessary]], and point them to the
documentation on [[#starting-a-conversation-with-orgeventbot][Starting a conversation with OrgEventBot]] and [[#joining-an-org][Joining an org]].




** Create events
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID:       create-events
   :END:


If you are the organizer, you need to create events in your org. If not, you
can skip to the [[#joining-an-org][Joining an org]] section.

The easiest way to create an event is to first choose =/orginfo= from
the menu (or type =/orginfo=) in your chat with =@OrgEventBot=, then
select the desired org from the list of organizations, and then choose
"Create Event" as shown in the video below:

#+name: fig:create-event
#+caption: Creating a new event.
[[file:images/create-event.gif]]

#+html: </details>

After you choose "Create Event" you will need to fill out various
options such as the name, description, latitude and longitude (so that the
map feature works), and the date. For the date, the only format
currently supported is

- =YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss=

Where =YYYY= is the four digit year, =MM= is the two digit month, =DD=
is the two digit day, =hh= is the hour (in 24-hour time so 2 pm is
14), =mm= is the two digit minute, and =ss= is the two digit second.

** Joining an org
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID:       joining-an-org
   :END:

You can join an org that someone else has created in order to see
upcoming events. You do not need to join an org if you [[#create-a-new-org][create a new
org]] since you will automatically be a part of it.

To join an org, you can select =/join= from the Telegram menu or type
=/join= in your conversation with =@OrgEventBot=. This will send a
join request to the owner of the org. Once they approve, you will
receive a Telegram message indicating you are part of the org and can
view upcoming events using the =/upcoming= command as shown in the
video below.

* FAQ
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID:     faq
   :END:

** How do I chat with members of my org?

To chat with other members individually you can send them a message on
Telegram or you can create a Telegram Group so that people can message
the group.

=@OrgEventBot= does not include a separate chat feature
since Telegram is already a full featured chat app. Instead
=@OrgEventBot= adds features for managing organizations and events on
top of the existing chat features.

** Why use OrgEventBot instead of a shared calendar?

Shared calendars are a good option but many people and organizations
are choosing apps because calendars often rely on email (which is
harder to track), lack chat features, and are generally clunkier.

** Why use OrgEventBot instead of another app?

OrgEventBot bot is *free*, has *no ads*, and is built on top of one of
the most commonly used chat apps (Telegram). By using OrgEventBot, you
don't need to install another app to manage teams/events/organizations
and you get all the features of Telegram.
